# Changelog

## 0.3.7 — 2026-06-12

### Breaking

- `steps.waitForState` / `Utils.waitForState` now **throw on timeout** instead of
  logging a warning and continuing. Both return `Promise<boolean>` (`true` = state
  reached; `false` only in optional mode).
  **Migration:** intentional probes ("is the banner there?") add `{ optional: true }`
  to keep the soft behavior — the call then resolves `false` instead of rejecting:
  ```ts
  await steps.waitForState('confirmationModal', 'CheckoutPage', 'visible');                       // throws on timeout
  const open = await steps.waitForState('promoBanner', 'HomePage', 'visible', { optional: true }); // probe
  ```
  Internal pre-action waits (`click`, `fill`, `hover`, drag, extraction attached-waits,
  `getListedElement`, `waitAndClick`) now fail earlier with an element-qualified
  `did not reach state '<state>'` error instead of falling through to the primitive's
  opaque timeout. `waitAndClick` deliberately does not forward `optional`.

### Added

- `StepOptions.timeout` — per-call timeout override on `waitForState` (falls back to
  the instance timeout), and `StepOptions.optional` — the soft-probe switch above.
- `BaseFixtureOptions.interceptionRetry` (default `true`) — set `false` so clicks
  intercepted by an overlaying element **fail** with the original
  `intercepts pointer events` error instead of silently falling back to
  `dispatchEvent('click')`. Recommended for adversarial / bug-discovery suites where
  stuck modals and cookie walls are bugs, not noise. Threaded
  `BaseFixture` → `Steps` / `ElementInteractions` → `Interactions`, like `timeout`.
- When the interception fallback does fire, it is now report-visible: a Playwright
  test annotation `{ type: 'interception-fallback', description }` naming
  `PageName.elementName` is pushed (visible in HTML reports), plus a `warn` log with
  the first line of the original error. The element identity travels via the new
  `ClickOptions.subject` string, set by every click entry point that knows the names.
- `typecheck:tests` script (`tsc -p tsconfig.tests.json`) — the test suite is now
  typechecked and runs as part of `test:unit`; raw-`Locator` drift in specs is a
  compile error.
- `check:publishable` script — fails on any `file:`/`link:` dependency; wired into
  `prepublishOnly` so an unpublishable state can never reach `npm publish` again.

### Fixed

- `@civitas-cerebrum/sql-client` is resolved from the npm registry (`^0.1.0`); the
  previous `file:../sql-client` dependency made the package unpublishable.
- Honest docs for `force` / `withoutScrolling` (`ClickOptions` / `StepOptions` JSDoc,
  README, API reference): both dispatch a DOM `'click'` event directly — no pointer
  simulation, no actionability checks. NOT Playwright's `force: true`; rename pending
  in a future major.
- README truth pass:
  - "Advanced: Raw Interactions API" rewritten to the `WebElement`-only reality
    (raw `Locator`s were dropped in 0.2.6; `new WebElement(locator)` is the documented
    bridging seam) and now lists the sanctioned escape hatches
    (`(element as WebElement).locator`, the `page` fixture).
  - `getText` contract corrected: returns `null` when the element has no text content.
  - `verifyCount` documents the `greaterThanOrEqual` / `lessThanOrEqual` variants and
    range combinations.
  - Matcher list includes `html` and `outerHtml`.
  - `waitForState` documented with both modes (throwing default + `optional` probe).
  - Coverage claim relabeled: the CI gate is **API (method-invocation) coverage**,
    not line/branch coverage.
